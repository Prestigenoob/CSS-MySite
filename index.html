        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>After struggling to find a career path that suited me best, I found myself in the programming industry. I had always had an interest in computers, mainly full-stack or web design, and finally made that dream a reality in the early summer of 2022.</p>

        <h3>Reptile Husbandry</h3>
        <p>Based out of Arizona, I found myself also diving deep in a long passion of mine, animal husbandry. I always had pets growing up, from dogs, rabbits, fish, cats, and even for a brief moment I had a peahen. I started reptile keeping back in 2017 with one crested gecko and that started opening new doors to me. I am now a hobbyist reptile breeder currently focusing on super dalmation crested geckos.</p>

        <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p>I have been hiking across the United states. From the sequoias to Key West to Kentucky, Ocras Islands. One of my favorite places to explore the wilderness, would have to Yellowstone National Park. The abundance of wildlife, thermal features, and dynamic terrain is such an incredible sight to see. I have gone rappeling in Zion, backpacking through the Grand Canyon, and river rafting in Moab.</p>
